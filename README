modcalc is a simple program to help calculate modulo.

Modulo is a common mathmatical operator in C and other languages, that does not have "button" on
    most calculators to complete this operation.
    
    note: The current version of modcalc uses the cs50 library, the only functions being used from this library are:
        GetString()
        GetInt()
        
    Planned revision: use standard libraries only.
